# Jepsen MongoDB tests

Evaluates single-document compare-and-set against a MongoDB cluster.

## Examples

```sh
# Short test with defaults taken from config.edn
lein run config.edn

```

## Building and running as a single jar

```sh
lein uberjar
java -jar target/jepsen.mongodb-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar config.edn ...
```

## Full usage

usage is all config file driven now.

## TODO

* Would like to use schema to validate configs, help avoid typos
* can we poll for replication working as per: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25137283/eval-inline-mongodb-replica-set-config?rq=1  - or is that what jepsen is already doing?
* re-enable protocol version setting
